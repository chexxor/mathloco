# Design System

Ratified 2026-11-01 (`design-ratify`, phase 3). Decisions with their reasoning: `.notes/DECISIONS.md`
D82–D109 and `.design/records/`. Machine record: `.design/decisions.json` (42 keys). Every ratio below
was read back out of the Firefox renderer (`.design/grill/contrast-oracle.mjs`), not computed from the
oklch by hand — where the two disagree, the renderer won and the older number is corrected in
`.design/grill/contrast/gen-ratify-cfg.mjs`'s header.

Character: **playful — plurality made possible through mathematics.** Energy comes from contrast of
size, weight and colour used with intent, never from oversized-everything. Decided 2026-10-31 (round 1,
operator overrode the calm-editorial recommendation).

Tokens live in one place: `src/styles/global.css` → `@theme`. If a value is not in that block, it is
not a design value.

## Colour — named roles only

| Role | Value | Means | Measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| `paper` | `oklch(98.5% .006 85)` | the page ground | — |
| `panel` | `oklch(97% .008 85)` | a quiet fill, **not** a layer | 1.04 vs paper |
| `tint` | `oklch(95% .03 152)` | hover fill; carries ink | ink on tint 10.96 |
| `ink` | `oklch(32% .045 152)` | text, and the ground of the one dark band | 12.02 on paper |
| `ink-hover` | `oklch(40% .055 152)` | the primary button's hover fill | 7.33 under `band-text`, 1.39 over `ink` |
| `ink-2` | `oklch(45% .035 152)` | secondary text, chip label, cancelled title | 7.02 |
| `ink-3` | `oklch(52% .028 152)` | meta, the dated line, "time not set" | 5.21 |
| `rule` | `oklch(65.5% .03 152)` | the only boundary role | 3.01 on paper, 4.00 on ink |
| `gold` | `oklch(55% .12 62)` | quiet action, notice word, caution keyline | 4.82 text and keyline |
| `gold-on-ink` | `oklch(76% .06 84)` | same role on the dark band | 5.80 on ink |
| `band-text` | `oklch(93% .008 152)` | text on ink; also the primary button label | 10.19 on ink |
| `path-calendar` / `-meetup` / `-discord` / `-mobilizon` | `50/.11/205`, `47/.15/315`, `50/.14/35`, `50/.10/105` | one reserved hue per join path | 5.28 / 7.09 / 6.15 / 5.68 on paper |
| `path-*-tint` | `95% .03 <hue>` | chip track, deliberately flat | 1.12 vs paper |
| `path-*-on-ink` | `70/.11/205`, `72/.15/315`, `71/.14/35`, `69/.10/105` | the same four paths on the dark band | 4.91 / 4.74 / 4.59 / 4.57 |

**Never** use a Tailwind palette colour (`text-gray-600`, `bg-blue-100`, `text-red-600`) where a role
exists; use the role. **Never** add a signal hue: the system has no red and no amber, and severity is
carried by the notice's keyline and word (D102). **Never** put `gold` on a `tint` (4.39, under AA) —
tints carry ink, gold carries paper. **Never** put a keylined control on a `panel` (`rule` on panel =
2.88, under the 3.0 boundary bar). **Never** let a coloured fill express a state (every shipped state
fill measures 1.05–1.09 = flat).

Bars, non-negotiable: **4.5** text (3.0 for text at/below the `display-2` step), **3.0** for a boundary
or graphic, **1.35** for "this is a separate layer", **24px** minimum target, **44px** for the primary
path.

**A hover always goes lighter.** `ink` → `ink-hover`, `paper` → `tint`; a control that darkens on hover
next to one that lightens is two grammars. On the layer bar this is not cosmetic: at `L` 38 the hover
fill sits 1.29 from the resting fill, which is FLAT — the hover simply does not happen.

**Focus rings take one role per ground:** `outline-gold` on paper (4.82) and `outline-band-text` on the
dark band (10.19), always with `outline-2 outline-offset-2`. `gold` on the band is 2.50 = an invisible
keyboard ring, and the shipped artifact proved that failure mode twice (`focus:shadow-outline-blue` was
a Tailwind 2 name that generated nothing).

## Spacing — 4px grid, eight steps

| Tailwind step | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 12 | 16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| px | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 24 | 32 | 48 | 64 |

Rows and lists sit on **12px padding, 8px gaps** ("comfy", round 6 Q4). Notice padding is 12/16.

**Never** use a step outside that set. The 20px orphan (`mt-5`, `sm:mt-5`: 5 writes) maps to **24** in
`design-apply`; `gap-3.5` (14px) → **12**, `gap-1.5` (6px) → **8**. If no step fits, change the scale,
do not write `p-[13px]`.

## Type — one face for content, one for chrome, 1.200 ramp

| Token | Size | Line height | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text-micro` | 11.1px | 16px | nav narrow tier, chip label, notice meta |
| `text-label` | 13.3px | 16px | nav links, buttons, meta, status word |
| `text-body` | 16px | 24px | body copy |
| `text-lede` | 19.2px | 28px | intro paragraph, card title |
| `text-subhead` | 23px | 28px *(derived)* | section heading |
| `text-heading` | 27.7px | 36px *(derived)* | page heading |
| `text-display-1…4` | 33.2 / 39.8 / 47.8 / 57.3px | 36 / 44 / 52 / 60px | **the locator** — one element per screen: the when/where line once real schedule work exists, the page `h1` until then |

Leading is carried by the size token — never write a bare `leading-*` next to a size. Serif body copy
reads at `leading-prose` (1.6). Display leading floor is 1.05; the four display line boxes land on the
4px grid and each clears its measured ink box.

**One display step per screen: the screen's primary locator.** That is the one element answering "which
page is this, and when and where". Section `h2`s are `text-heading`, never a display step; a display
step never goes on a punchline, and never on two elements in one screen. Where the locator lives is
not permanent: **when a real dated line exists, the display step moves to it and the title steps down
to `text-heading`** (operator ruling 2026-11-01, D112 — the rule used to read "reserved for when/where",
which on a landing page whose event sections are switched off would have left the display step
reserved for content that does not exist, and flattened the title to 27.7px beside two 27.7px section
headings). Applied today: landing `h1` = `text-display-1` base / `text-display-2` at ≥sm, `h2`s and the
footer sum glyph = `text-heading`, 404 and chat `h1` = `text-display-1`.

**Never** use `text-display-4` (57.3px) below a 375 viewport without a cap. Two measured fits, because
the face matters and the older number was taken in the wrong one: in **PT Serif** "Mathematical"
measures 367.6px against 343px of content width, and in the chrome face the strings that actually sit
at display size leave 4.8px of margin at display-4 (longest word 338.2px) against 2 lines and 98px at
display-2 — `.design/fonts/display-fit-chrome.json`, Public Sans Variable at weight 800, since 800 is
measurably wider than 700 (458.0 vs 452.4 for the club name at display-1). Faces: PT Serif
(`font-body`) for content — **400 and 700 both load** — and Public Sans variable for chrome, installed
from `src/styles/fonts.css`. **Never** set `font-weight: 500/600` on serif text: PT Serif has no
variable build, so it renders regular or bold and the weight you wrote is the weight you do not get.

## Radius

`rounded-control` and `rounded-card`, both **6px** from one base. Chips are not pills: a chip is
carried by its hue keyline plus its word, and a second radius role with no measured need is a third
thing to enforce. **Never** use `rounded-lg`/`rounded-md` (Tailwind's ramp) on a control or card.

## Elevation — hairline means on the page, shadow means above it

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `inset-shadow-rule` | `inset 0 0 0 1px` `rule` | every boundary on paper and on the band |
| `inset-shadow-gold` | `inset 0 0 0 1px` `gold` | the caution variant of a notice |
| `inset-shadow-path-*` | 1px of the path hue | chip and tag keylines |
| `shadow-e1` | `0 1px 2px rgba(32,57,39,.165)` | something that floats: a menu |
| `shadow-e2` | `0 2px 5px -1px …,.22 + 0 12px 28px -6px …,.30` | something that floats over content |

Level 1 measures **1.35** at the contact edge, level 2 **1.51** — both at or over the layer bar. The
stops are ink-tinted on purpose: a black stop wide enough to read at a wide blur paints a 2.10 grey
band.

**Never** use a `border` for a keyline — it adds 2px and silently breaks the control-height
arithmetic. **Never** put a shadow on a card, or on a hovered card: cards are part of the page.
**Never** use `shadow-sm/md/lg` (measured 1.25 = decoration).

## Controls — heights are derived, not chosen

`height = ceil4(measured line box) + 2 × an S3 pad`. Pads come only from the spacing scale.

| Step | Height | Use |
|---|---|---|
| chip | 24px | chip / inline status (spacing exception must hold) |
| `s32` | 32px | quiet button, inline controls |
| `s40` | 40px | secondary button, a notice's retry |
| `s48` | 48px | primary button — the only step that clears the 44px AAA bar; it belongs to the join path |

**Never** let one component family render at three heights (the shipped CTA measured 50 / 58 / 62px
across breakpoints) and **never** ship a control under 24px (the shipped 404 links measured 19px).

## Buttons and chips

| Component | Construction | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| primary | `ink` fill, `band-text` label, 48px | 10.19, hover 7.33 |
| secondary | `paper` fill, `inset-shadow-rule`, `ink` label, 40px, hover fill `tint` | 12.02 / 10.96 |
| quiet | `gold` label, 32px standalone; **no keyline inside a notice** | 4.82 |
| chip | its own component, not a button: `ink-2` label on `path-*-tint`, `inset-shadow-path-*`, 24px | 6.27 label, 5.28–7.09 edge |

A box has exactly **one** boundary. A notice's action therefore takes the `quiet` label with no keyline
of its own — a second `rule` hairline 12px inside the notice's own keyline reads as a double border and
is illegal on a panel anyway (2.88). Because gold is also the caution colour, an in-notice action is
distinguished from the status word by an **underline at rest**, its lane, and its size — never by a
second colour.

## Notices, status words, freshness

- A notice = **word + keyline** on the page's own ground: edge `inset-shadow-rule` (3.01 paper / 4.00
  band), word `ink`, body `ink-2`, meta `ink-3`, padding 12/16. One-line notice **48px**, two-line body
  **64px**. Caution variant: `gold` keyline and word (4.82); on the band, `gold-on-ink` (5.80). No fill.
- Status is a **word**: `Scheduled` / `Cancelled` / `Past` in the series lane when stacked, in its own
  24px chip column when wide (measured: a word reflows +0px, a chip costs +7px). Cancelled title goes to
  `ink-2`.
- "Time not set" is stated **in the date lane** where the clock would be (`ink-3`), never defaulted to
  12:00 am, and never rendered as a date.
- Freshness is **one dated line, always**, in the same slot on every surface: `ink-3`, tabular numerals,
  e.g. "Schedule copied 30 Oct 2026". No staleness alarm: the real harvested feed has gaps of 4, 10 and
  4 days, so any 7-day threshold fires in an ordinary month.

**Never** use strikethrough or colour as the only status cue. **Never** hide a cancelled event from the
page while `/events.ics` announces `STATUS:CANCELLED`. **Never** invent a threshold and call it
freshness.

## States: empty, loading, failed

- **Zero upcoming events converts.** It is not a sentence (104px, nothing to press) and it is never
  hidden (47px): status word, `text-lede` title, two-line body, a 48px primary, a 40px secondary, the
  dated line. The hero's "Next:" label changes to "Nothing scheduled" rather than disappearing, so an
  empty calendar is distinguishable from a broken page.
- **Loading is one 24px `role="status"` line, no motion.** No spinner, no skeleton (the shipped skeleton
  material measures 1.05 fill / 1.18 edge = a rectangle pretending to be content). Reserve the height so
  the page does not jump when content lands.
- **Failure is the notice above with a 40px retry**, and the error branch must exist in the server-rendered
  HTML: a JavaScript-off visitor can otherwise never leave the loading branch.
- **Missing content is a designed state, never a build failure** (operator, 2026-11-01). A gate may fail a
  build when a feed is malformed; it must not fail one because the club has nothing scheduled. Empty
  sections get their own content instead.
- **Past events do not belong in the upcoming section.** Whether the site shows them at all is an open
  question for the post-design review; if it does, they live on a separate surface, never interleaved,
  and a past permalink keeps a `Past` status word rather than going 404.

## Layout rules that came out of the colour rounds

- **At most one dark band per screen**, ground = `ink`, text `band-text`. That is where the quote and
  interview cards live; cards inside it are flat with the same `rule` hairline (4.00 there).
- **Photo-free by construction**: no surface may require a photograph, because none of the club's
  existing images contains a person (D86/D94). The hero motif may be derived from the operator's own
  sphere diagram only.
- The nav is **one row, `flex-wrap: nowrap`**, with a narrow tier below 360px (links at `text-micro`,
  gaps 8px → 262px needed, fits a 320 viewport's 288px and a 300's 268px). A label set that stops
  fitting is a probe failure, not a silent wrap.

## Copy

State the fact, name where it came from, give a path out, carry the date. **Never** state a frequency
("weekly", "every other week", "bimonthly") — the site publishes **series names and real dates** (D92),
and a fabricated "join us every week" survived two years in the shipped copy. **Never** put an
unbracketed invented fact in a specimen: `[YEAR]`, `[CADENCE]`, `[N]`, `[verbatim]` stay bracketed until
a source exists.

## Motion

| Kind | Duration | Easing |
|---|---|---|
| colour, shadow | `duration-150` | `linear` (this is the `@theme` default) |
| anything that moves | `duration-250` | `ease-out`, written explicitly |

Tailwind v4 has no `--duration-*` namespace (measured: `duration-color` resolves to nothing), so the
two steps are written as the numbers above. **Never** use `duration-300` or a 400ms tier. **Always**
guard animation with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — the shipped artifact contains 0 occurrences of
that string.

Weights: PT Serif ships two faces and both are imported (latin 400 + latin 700), so in serif text the
only legal weights are `400` and `700`. `500`/`600`/`800` are legal **only** in chrome (the sans stack),
where one variable file renders five distinct weights — measured 46 text runs on the landing page now
resolve through Public Sans Variable at 500/600/800 instead of a synthesised system-ui.

## Enforcement

```bash
node .design/gen-token-map.mjs  # regenerate the apply worklist from src/; exit 1 = a class write has no mapping
node .design/ratify-check.mjs   # token block → Tailwind resolver + renderer contrast (exit 0 = all bars hold)
npm run check:classes           # every written class resolves to CSS — catches a token used as a class that does not exist
npm run check:render            # build, then measure dist/client in Firefox: control heights, measured contrast,
                                # one dark band, keyline layer bar, one display step, faces actually loaded
npm run verify                  # the full CI gate set
```

Two things these gates **cannot** catch, so enforce must be value-aware: Tailwind v4's dynamic spacing
scale makes `mt-23` (92px) resolve, and "the class exists" is not "the value is on the scale". That is
why `.design/token-map.md` is generated from the writes rather than written by hand — it exits 1 if any
class in a replaced bucket has no mapping.

`design-enforce` (phase 5) adds the class-level linter: off-scale spacing, Tailwind colours where a role
exists, `border` keylines, `shadow-*` outside `e1/e2`, `duration-*` outside 150/250, and any frequency
word in event prose.

## Not wired yet (lands in `design-apply`, phase 4)

- Markup still writes the old palette in the state surfaces only: `DiscordSummary.svelte` (`bg-red-50`,
  `text-red-600`, `bg-blue-50`, `text-gray-600`, `border-blue-600`, `prose-blue`) and `Checkmark.astro`
  (`text-green-500`). Those stay open because the fix is a notice/empty-state grammar, not a colour swap,
  and the token block keeps `--color-book-*` entries until the class writes go away — deleting a token
  before its class write does is what `check:classes` exists to catch.
- **Faces are wired** (apply batch 4a): `Layout.astro` imports `@fontsource/pt-serif/latin-400.css` and
  `latin-700.css`, and `src/styles/fonts.css` declares the one Public Sans variable latin face
  (26,832 B, `wght 100 900`) against the vendor file, because the package's only entry point declares
  three subsets — 53,020 B of woff2 — for a decision that ratified one latin file. Measured in the
  render gate: all three faces report `loaded`, chrome runs resolve through Public Sans Variable, and
  the artifact ships 3 woff2 instead of the 10 the old `@fontsource/pt-serif` index pulled in (it was
  shipping cyrillic for English copy).
  The one thing this cannot yet do: `check:render` proves the faces load on a **built page**, so a moved
  vendor path fails the gate instead of silently rendering in the fallback stack.
- `shadow-e1` / `shadow-e2` are defined-but-unused until the first floating surface exists. No modal or
  dropdown is in `src/` today.
- The four island defects found in round 7 (no reduced-motion guard, no height reservation, no
  JS-off escape from the loading branch, `{#if summary?.summary}` with no `{:else}`) are defects, not
  decisions, and ride along in that branch.
- `UpcomingMeetups.astro` has no `{:else}` either: an empty feed renders nothing at all. Per **D108**,
  missing content is a state with designed content — never a blank, and never a build failure. The
  batch order and the states to build are in `.design/token-plan.md`; the per-class worklist is
  `.design/token-map.md`.
